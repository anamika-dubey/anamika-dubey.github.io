**Subho Paul (Postdoctoral Researcher, Oct 2022 - Present):** I am a Post-doctoral Research Associate in the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Washington State University, Pullman, USA. I received my M.E. degree in Electrical Engineering with Power systems specialization from Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India, in 2016, and my Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from the Department of Electrical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, Roorkee, India, in 2021. From October 2021 to September 2022, I worked as a Postdoctoral Research Associate under the Indo-US UI-ASSIST project at IIT Roorkee. My research interest includes power system optimization, distribution network optimal power flow, microgrid energy management, and the application of deep learning techniques in power system. My current research work focuses on the impact analysis of communication and data issues on the performance of distribution network OPF analysis. I was the recipient of the University Gold Medal for standing first in order of merit in the M.E. degree from Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India, in 2016.
