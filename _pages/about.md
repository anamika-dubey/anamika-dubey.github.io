I am Huie-Rogers Endowed Chair Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering in the School of EECS at Washington State University (WSU), Pullman. I also hold a joint appointment as a Research Scientist at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). At WSU, I am affiliated with Energy Systems Innovation Center (ESIC). I received her MSE and Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Texas at Austin in 2012 and 2015, respectively. My research focuses on the model-based and data-driven methods for decision-support in active power distribution systems for improved efficiency, operational flexibility, and resilience.
