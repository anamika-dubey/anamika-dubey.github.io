**Charlotte Wertz (PhD Student, Fall 2023)** –I am a 1st year PhD student at Washington State University studying Electrical and Computer Engineering. My research interests are in the intersection of power system resiliency and energy equity. I am part of the Distinguished Graduate Research Program (DGRP), a fellowship that enables me to collaborate with Pacific Northwest National Laboratory for my dissertation. I am currently funded by Graduate Assistance for Areas of National Need (GAANN) fellowship and being trained on applying computer science principles to power engineering. I received my bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering with a focus on power systems from Washington State University in May 2023. [Github](https://github.com/cwertz77).
