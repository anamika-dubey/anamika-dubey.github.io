**Ninad Kiran Gaikwad (PhD, Spring 2022)** - I am from Mumbai, Maharashtra, in India. I received my BTech in Electrical Engineering from Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute, Mumbai in 2012, my MTech in Power Electronics and Power Systems from Sardar Patel College of Engineering, Mumbai in 2016, and my MS in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Florida, Gainesville in 2021. I am currently a Research Assistant at the SCALE lab pursuing my Ph.D. in Electrical engineering and MS in Computer Science from WSU. My current research focuses on developing computationally efficient representations of building thermal models for intelligent control of networked buildings. Also, my other research interests include employing Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques for optimal control of energy systems, and forecasting of renewable energy generation. I aim to work as a researcher at a national laboratory after graduation and get back into academia at some point. During my free time, I like to take long road trips and play table tennis and guitar.
