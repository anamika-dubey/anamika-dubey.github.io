**Ninad Kiran Gaikwad (PhD, Spring 2022)** - I am currently a Research Assistant at the SCALE lab pursuing his PhD in Electrical engineering from WSU. My current research focuses on developing black and grey box building models for intelligent control of networked buildings. Also. my other research interests include employing Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques for optimal control of energy systems. I aim to work as a researcher at a national laboratory after graduation and get back into academia at some point. During my free time I like to take long road trips, play table tennis and guitar.
