**Aryan Ritwajeet Jha** - My current research focuses on Multi-Period Optimization in Power Distribution Networks with intertemporal constraints such as those introduced by energy storage systems. I put a strong emphasis on translating research into practical solutions through programming, mathematical modeling, and scientific computing. My aim is to empower power system engineers by simplifying complex analyses and facilitating the transformation of mathematical concepts into accessible, user-friendly tools. My academic background includes a BE in EEE from BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus in 2020 and graduate work in Power System Operation and Control at IIT Delhi between 2020-22. I love my colleagues, my course-mates and my professors, and I love working with people of diverse backgrounds and skill sets.
