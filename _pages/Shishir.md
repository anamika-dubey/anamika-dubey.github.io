**Shishir Lamichhane (PhD, 2023)**, I'm working as a graduate research assistant at the Energy Systems Innovation Centre (ESIC) at WSU. My research interests include power system modeling, resilient power systems with changing climate, decisions under uncertainty, and system restoration. My main focus is on developing a scalable framework for planning and optimization of electric power systems. I love doing yoga and meditation during my spare time.  I received my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from Pulchowk Campus, IOE in Nepal back in 2021.
