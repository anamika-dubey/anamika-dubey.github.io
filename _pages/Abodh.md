**Abodh Poudyal (Ph.D., Fall 2020):** I am fourth year Ph.D. student in Electrical Engineering in the school of EECS at Washington State University (WSU), Pullman. I completed my Bachelorâ€™s in Electrical Engineering from Institute of Engineering, Tribhuvan University in 2016 and MS in Electrical Engineering from South Dakota State University in 2020. My research interest is focused on resilience enhancement of electric power systems against extreme weather events through mathematical modeling and optimization. I am also interested on data analytics, application of learning-based methods for power grids, and tool development for smart grid operations. [website](https://abodh.github.io/).
