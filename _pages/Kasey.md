**Kasey Dettlaff** - I am a fourth-year undergraduate student studying electrical engineering at Washington State University. My research interests include the integration of renewables, smart-grid technology, and machine learning. I'm currently working on applying machine-learning concepts to building power consumption modeling. I also intern at Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories with a focus on power system protection. My ultimate goal is to make power safer, more sustainable, and more equitable. I'm projected to graduate in Fall 2024, after which I plan to pursue a Master's in electrical engineering.
