**Daniel Glover (PhD, Fall 2021)** - received my B.S. in Electrical Engineering and an M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Oklahoma Gallogly College of Engineering in 2020 and 2021.  I am currently a Ph.D. student at Washington State University in the school of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.  My active research topic is the application of AI and deep reinforcement learning for grid-edge device coordination in distribution systems, with a focus on safety and robustness by examining methods to mitigate the simulation-to-reality gap and domain shift phenomena for improved policy transfer.  I am also a National Intel Scholar, member of the American Indian Science and Engineering Society (AISES), Climate Change AI volunteer, and National GEM Fellow.
