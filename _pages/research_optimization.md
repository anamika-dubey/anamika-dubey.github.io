[**DER/Grid-Edge Coordination:**](_pages/research_optimization_detail) A conscious move towards a sustainable energy future with transportation electrification and building automation is continuing to push for more intelligence at the grid edge, necessitating new methods to reliably integrate millions of grid-edge devices. Our goal in this research theme is to develop computationally tractable and accurate grid-edge optimization algorithms. Our key contributions include (1) accurate and scalable centralized three-phase unbalanced optimal power flow algorithms, (2) scalable distributed algorithms for computational tractability, and (3) online optimization and use of reinforcement learning to manage fast-varying scenarios. Our unifying theme is to systematically leverage the physics of the electric power flow to develop domain-specific provably convergent approximation, relaxation, and decomposition techniques with superior performance compared to generic optimization algorithms. We are also working on an algorithmic framework for grid-edge coordination under limited data, computing, and communication.
