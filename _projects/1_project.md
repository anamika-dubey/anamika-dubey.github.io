The electric power grid is inundated with new challenges due to rapid decarbonization goals and extreme weather events. Our group's research in this theme is focused on climate change adaptation solutions for the power grid using controllable grid-edge resources. This research is crucial to solving emerging challenges to the grid due to rare contingencies like extreme hot/cold weather events (e.g., those recently observed in Texas and the Pacific Northwest), wildfires, and windstorms. The proposed research has provided a new framework to quantitatively evaluate the tradeoffs of multiple utility planning approaches and operational procedures on the outage risks faced by the community. Additionally, the proposed solutions to reduce outage risks have been implemented using an open-source platform to provide a proof-of-concept and are currently being prototyped for field demonstration in collaboration with industry and community stakeholders.
